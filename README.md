# Quantum Graph Invariants

This repository contains code used in the Exploring Quantum Graph Invariants research project by Luke Hawthorne, Jordan Larson, Isaiah Lee, and Lorenzo Lopez during spring 2025. The project was done under the [Purdue Experimental Math Lab](https://www.math.purdue.edu/pxml/index.html) under the supervision of Professor Thomas Sinclair, Patrick Debonis, and Connor Thompson.

The goal of the project was to characterize the the CP Index graph invariant introduced by Araiza et al. ([2018](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2203.05710)), characterize its 'relative' version, and compare it to the Quantum Lovasz theta invariant introduced by Duan et al. ([2013](https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2012.2221677)). With the help of this code, our group came up with a simplified formulation for the relative CP Index for graphs and proved that the CP Index and quantum Lovasz theta number are not equal in general.
